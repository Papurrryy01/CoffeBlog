            <h1>Coffee Bean Types</h1>
            <p> - There are four main coffee bean types, each with its own character. Arabica is the world’s favorite, known for its smooth, sweet taste with notes of fruit and chocolate. Robusta packs nearly double the caffeine, delivering a bold, bitter kick often used in espresso blends. Rarer varieties like Liberica bring floral, fruity, and smoky tones, while Excelsa—a branch of Liberica—adds tart, complex flavors that deepen blends. Together, they create the diverse coffee experiences we enjoy every day.</p>
            <p> - Beyond the bean itself, the origin and climate where coffee is grown also shape its flavor. Beans from Ethiopia often carry bright, fruity notes, while Colombian coffee is celebrated for its balance and smoothness. Brazilian beans lean toward nutty and chocolatey tones, and those from Vietnam tend to be bold and earthy. Altitude, soil, and harvesting methods all play a role in crafting the final taste profile.<p>
            <p> - Another key factor is the roasting process. Light roasts highlight the bean’s natural acidity and fruity characteristics, while medium roasts strike a balance of body and flavor. Dark roasts, on the other hand, develop smoky, caramelized notes with a bolder body, often masking subtle origins but delivering a rich, classic taste many love.</p>
            <p> - Finally, the brewing method determines how these flavors come to life in the cup. A French press produces a full-bodied, robust brew, while pour-over highlights clarity and delicate flavors. Espresso offers an intense, concentrated shot, and cold brew creates a smooth, refreshing drink with lower acidity. The same bean can taste completely different depending on how it’s prepared, making coffee endlessly versatile.</p>
